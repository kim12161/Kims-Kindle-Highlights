Forgiveness is the only way to heal. We can choose to forgive because we feel compassion for ourselves. We can let go of the resentment and declare, “That’s enough!

you will need to gain control over your lifestyle—and that’s often no small task. For example, you will need to spread out the intense work sessions so that you have time in between to recharge. This requires basic time-management skills. You’re also going to have to overcome your urge to procrastinate, because scheduling your work is meaningless if you don’t actually work in the time you set aside. This requires self-motivation. Finally, to obtain the highest possible levels of intensity, you need to choose the right locations, times of day, and durations to study. If you aren’t careful about how you select these three factors, you can unintentionally sabotage your ability to focus. This requires a smart planning strategy.

Part Two Cheat Sheet Step #1. Take Smart Notes • Always go to class and try to take the best notes possible. • For nontechnical courses, capture the big ideas by taking notes in the question/evidence/conclusion format. • For technical courses, record as many sample problems and answers as possible. Step #2. Demote Your Assignments • Work a little bit each day on your assignments; avoid suffering from day-before syndrome. • Read only the favored sources on the syllabus in detail. To decide how much time to spend on supplemental sources, remember the importance hierarchy: – readings that make an argument are more important than – readings that describe an event or person, which are more important than – readings that only provide context (i.e., speech transcripts, press clippings). • Take reading notes in the question/evidence/conclusion format. • Work in groups on problem sets, solve problems on the go, and write up your answers formally the first time. Step #3. Marshal Your Resources • Figure out exactly what the test will cover. • Cluster your notes for nontechnical courses. • Build mega-problem sets for technical courses. Step #4. Conquer the Material • Embrace the quiz-and-recall method. It’s the single most efficient way to study. • Spread out memorization over several days. Your mind can do only so much at a time. Step #5. Invest in “Academic Disaster Insurance” • Eliminate the question marks for topics covered in class or from the reading that you don’t understand. Step #6. Provide “A+” Answers • Look over the whole test first. • Figure out how much time you have to spend on each question (leaving a ten-minute cushion at the end). • Answer the questions in order of increasing difficulty. • Write out a mini-outline before tackling an essay question. • Use any and all leftover time to check and recheck your work.
